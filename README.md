# Email Spam Classifier

An email spam classifier is a tool that helps to identify and filter out unwanted emails, often referred to as spam. This project uses machine learning to automatically classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). The final product includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications. The algorithm used for classification is Naive Bayes.

## Features

- Automatically classifies emails as spam or ham
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Uses Naive Bayes algorithm for classification

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main file that contains the Streamlit web application code.
- `model.py`: Contains the code for training and using the Naive Bayes classifier.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Algorithm

The Naive Bayes algorithm is used for classifying emails. It is a simple yet powerful algorithm suitable for text classification tasks like spam detection.
